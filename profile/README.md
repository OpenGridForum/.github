## An Open Global Forum for Advanced Distributed Computing

**OGF** is an open global community committed to driving the rapid evolution and adoption of modern advanced applied distributed computing, including cloud, grid and associated storage, networking and workflow methods. OGF is focused on developing and promoting innovative scalable techniques, applications and infrastructures to improve productivity in the enterprise and within the international research, science and business communities.

OGF accomplishes its work through **open forums, interactions and events** that build the community, explore trends, share optimal approaches, document findings and consolidate these results where appropriate into standards. The output products that result from this process document and codify best practices and standards that provide the basis for some of the largest and most powerful operational computing infrastructure systems in the world.

OGF is proud to have contributed to the technology and standards underlying grid computing that led to many other developments including much of the technology underlying clouds and led to many other projects that are still contributing to scientific, academic, and business computing at scale. 

We use these GitHub organizational pages to coordinate new work on projects that OGF has in progress, including  support of [OGF document authoring](https://docs.ogf.org/ogf-documents-and-workspaces/ogf-document-templates) for OGF working and community groups and liaison relationships with other standards developing organizations to support reuse of OGF standards in other contexts for wider reach and/or longer lifetime.

Ideas for formation of new working groups as per the long-standing guidelines in [GFD.3](https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.3.pdf) and [GFD.152](https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.152.pdf) and for their operation using these new tools are also being accepted and welcomed. Please [contact us](https://ogf.org/ogf/doku.php/contact.html) if needed for further details.
